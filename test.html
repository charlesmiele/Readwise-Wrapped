            <p><em>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand rowers. Two things keep the speed of the galley
                down. One is that individual rowers don’t see any result from working harder. The other is that, in a group
                of a thousand people, the average rower is likely to be pretty average. If you took ten people at random out
                of the big galley and put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go faster. They would have both
                carrot and stick to motivate them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought that he could have
                a visible effect on the speed of the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely to
                notice and complain. But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when you take the ten best rowers out
                of the big galley and put them in a boat together. They will have all the extra motivation that comes from
                being in a small group. But more importantly, by selecting that small a group you can get the best rowers.
                Each one will be in the top 1%. It’s a much better deal for them to average their work together with a small
                group of their peers than to average it with everyone.</em></p>

            <p><em>At Via web one of our rules of thumb was run upstairs. Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a
                big, fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The bully
                can probably run downstairs as fast as you can. Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage.
                Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him. What this meant in practice was that we
                deliberately sought hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our software, both equally
                valuable in proportion to their difficulty, we’d always take the harder one. Not just because it was more
                valuable, but because it was harder. We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors to follow us over
                difficult ground. Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the mountains, where the troops
                of the central government can’t follow. I can remember times when we were just exhausted after wrestling all
                day with some horrible technical problem. And I’d be delighted, because something that was hard for us would
                be impossible for our competitors.</em></p>

            <p><em>He opened his eyes and looked up gratefully at O’Brien. At sight of the heavy, lined face, so ugly and so
                intelligent, his heart seemed to turn over. If he could have moved he would have stretched out a hand and
                laid it on O’Brien’s arm. He had never loved him so deeply as at this moment, and not merely because he had
                stopped the pain. The old feeling, that at bottom it did not matter whether O’Brien was a friend or an
                enemy, had come back. O’Brien was a person who could be talked to. Perhaps one did not want to be loved so
                much as to be understood. O’Brien had tortured him to the edge of lunacy, and in a little while, it was
                certain, he would send him to his death. It made no difference. In some sense that went deeper than
                friendship, they were intimates; somewhere or other, although the actual words might never be spoken, there
                was a place where they could meet and talk. O’Brien was looking down at him with an expression which
                suggested that the same thought might be in his own mind. When he spoke it was in an easy, conversational
                tone.</em></p>

            <p><em>If you're 10–20: These are prime years!

                Go deep on things. Become an expert.
                In particular, try to go deep on multiple things. (To varying degrees, I tried to go deep on languages,
                programming, writing, physics, math. Some of those stuck more than others.) One of the main things you
                should try to achieve by age 20 is some sense for which kinds of things you enjoy doing. This probably won't
                change a lot throughout your life and so you should try to discover the shape of that space as quickly as
                you can.
                Don't stress out too much about how valuable the things you're going deep on are... but don't ignore it
                either. It should be a factor you weigh but not by itself dispositive.
                To the extent that you enjoy working hard, do. Subject to that constraint, it's not clear that the returns
                to effort ever diminish substantially. If you're lucky enough to enjoy it a lot, be grateful and take full
                advantage!
                Make friends over the internet with people who are great at things you're interested in. The internet is one
                of the biggest advantages you have over prior generations. Leverage it.
                Aim to read a lot.
                If you think something is important but people older than you don't hold it in high regard, there's a
                reasonable chance that you're right and they're wrong. Status lags by a generation or more.
                Above all else, don't make the mistake of judging your success based on your current peer group. By all
                means make friends but being weird as a teenager is generally good.
                But having good social skills confers life-long benefits. So, don't write them off. Get good at making a
                good first impression, being funny (if possible... this author still working on it...), speaking publicly.
                Make things. Operating in a space with a lot of uncertainty is a very different experience to learning
                something.
                More broadly, nobody is going to teach you to think for yourself. A large fraction of what people around you
                believe is mistaken. Internalize this and practice coming up with your own worldview. The correlation
                between it and those around you shouldn't be too strong unless you think you were especially lucky in your
                initial conditions.
                If you're in the US and go to a good school, there are a lot of forces that will push you towards following
                traintracks laid by others rather than charting a course yourself. Make sure that the things you're pursuing
                are weird things that you want to pursue, not whatever the standard path is. Heuristic: do your friends at
                school think your path is a bit strange? If not, maybe it's too normal.
                Figure out a way to travel to San Francisco and to meet other people who've moved there to pursue their
                dreams. Why San Francisco? San Francisco is the Schelling point for high-openness, smart, energetic,
                optimistic people. Global Weird HQ. Take advantage of opportunities to travel to other places too, of
                course.
                Find vivid examples of success in the domains you care about. If you want to become a great scientist, try
                to find ways to spend time with good (or, ideally, great) scientists in person. Watch YouTube videos of
                interviews. Follow some on Twitter.
                People who did great things often did so at very surprisingly young ages. (They were grayhaired when they
                became famous... not when they did the work.) So, hurry up! You can do great things.</em></p>

            <p><em>first half of Bruce Springsteen’s autobiography makes some things abundantly clear:

                He had no natural ability to play the guitar. In fact, after his first lessons, he quit, unable to play a
                note.

                He had no singing talent. Every group he was part of needed a lead singer, and it wasn’t him.

                And just about everyone dismissed him. Audiences walked out, his first agent simply stopped returning his
                calls and bandmates gave up and moved on.

                He didn’t even know how to drive a car. Not only wasn’t he dating in high school, he wasn’t even cruising
                around town, being a charismatic rock star.

                Talent is overrated. Skill is acquirable.

                Showing up is something almost every creative leader has in common. In business, in the arts, in society.
                Consistently shipping the work, despite the world’s reaction, despite the nascent nature of our skill,
                despite the doubts.

                And community is essential. The people you surround yourself with can reinforce your story, raise the bar
                and egg you on.

                After the fact, the community becomes an integral part of your story of success. But first, you have to
                commit to the journey.</em></p>
